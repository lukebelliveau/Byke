# Byke

Byke is an application for bikesharers. Use it to find the closest bikeshare stations to your current location and your destination, then get directions!

This is a work in progress with support for Android and iOS. Built with React Native. Currently only supports Divvy in Chicago, but this could be extended to any bikeshare program with information publicly available.
